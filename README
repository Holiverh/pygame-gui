VERY INCOMPLETE ATM

Implements GUI features for PyGame. Should plug right into your existing
PyGame installtion and code. Currently implementing the base functionality
and widget set.

Use of the distutils setup script might cause your PyGame
installation to break due to the fact that an __init__.py is required
for the package to be installed. As it attempts to instlal it self
into PyGame's install directory this would result in PyGame's __init__.py
being overwritten. To work around this at the moment we use a copy of
PyGame 1.9.1's __init__.py.
